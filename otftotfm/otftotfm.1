.SH NAME
otftotfm \- create TeX font metrics from PostScript OpenType fonts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B otftotfm
\%[\fB-a\fR]
\%[\fBoptions\fR]
\%\fIotffile\fR [\fIfontname\fR]
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR Otftotfm
creates TeX font metrics and a 
.M dvips 1 -like
encoding file that correspond, as far as possible, to a PostScript-flavored
OpenType font. The generated files are named
.IR fontname .vf,
.IR fontname .tfm,
and so forth. They are written into the current directory, or, with the
.B \-a 
option, into a TeX Directory Structure.
.LP
OpenType fonts come with
.IR features .
Turning on the "small capitals" feature, for example, replaces lower-case
letter glyphs with the corresponding small capitals. Other features control
the spacing of capital letters, whether numbers are lining or old-style,
and so forth. (You can check the features a font supports using "\fBotfinfo\fR \-f";
see
.M otfinfo 1 .)
.LP
OpenType features can be more complex than TeX can handle, but many
features useful for Western scripts (Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, for
example) are supported by TeX, including:
.IP * 3
Glyph substitutions, such as replacing 'a' with small caps 
.SM 'A'.
.IP * 3
Pair kerns, such as moving 'AV' closer together.
.IP * 3
Ligatures, such as replacing 'f' and 'i' with an integrated 'fi'
glyph.
.IP * 3
Simple glyph positionings, such as adding extra space on either side of 'W'.
.LP
Otftotfm reads an OpenType font, turns on any font features you choose, and
generates font metrics and a dvips encoding file that, together, implement
as much of those features as possible. By default otftotfm creates TFM and
VF files using the
.M pltotf 1
and
.M vptovf 1
programs, but supply the
.B \-\-pl
option and it will generate human-readable PL and VPL files.
'
.SS Common features
.PP
Even "default" ligatures and pair kerns are optional in OpenType
fonts, so you'll generally provide the
.BR \-f kern
and 
.BR \-f liga
options to turn them on. Other features you may be interested in include
.BR \-f cpsp,
for capital spacing;
.BR \-f dlig,
for optional ligatures;
.BR \-f lnum,
.BR \-f onum,
.BR \-f "pnum, and"
.BR \-f tnum,
to control digit glyphs;
.BR \-f smcp,
for small capitals;
.BR \-f swsh,
for swash variants; and
.BR \-f cswh,
for contextual swash. See the OPENTYPE FEATURES section below for more
information on these and other features.
'
.SS Automatic mode
.PP
Automatic mode, triggered by the
.BR \-a / \-\-automatic
option, is the easiest way to use otftotfm. In automatic mode, otftotfm
will install the font metrics and encoding files where TeX can find them,
and additionally install a Type 1 font and mapping for dvips. This requires
a TeX installation that follows the TeX Directory Structure standard
(http://www.tug.org/tds/), such as most Unix TeX installations.
'
.PP
Simple instructions for web2c-based installations:
'
.IP 1. 3
Create a
.I $HOME/texmf
directory.
.IP 2. 3
Add a
.I $HOME/texmf/dvips
subdirectory to hold encodings and map files. Otftotfm will create and
modify a file
.I $HOME/texmf/dvips/lcdftools/lcdftools.map
containing information about fonts it creates.
.IP 3. 3
Tell
.M dvips 1
how to find the
.I lcdftools.map
file. The simplest way is to create a file
.IR $HOME/texmf/dvips/config.ps ,
containing the single line "p +lcdftools.map".
You could also add this line to your
.IR ~/.dvipsrc
or an existing
.IR config.ps ,
or create a script
.I $HOME/texmf/dvips/updmap
that does the right thing. 
.PP
Now, after running "otftotfm
.B \-a
.IR file .otf
.IR fontname \&",
you will immediately be able to refer to the font in TeX using the
.I fontname
you supplied to otftotfm. You will have to write .fd files
and/or typescripts to make the font conveniently accessible from LaTeX or
ConTeXt. See the DIAGNOSTICS section if you have problems with these
instructions.
'
.PP
In automatic mode, otftotfm first searches your $TEXMF path for a writable
directory. Often this will be your "$HOME/texmf" directory; you might want
to create this directory now. It then installs files under that directory
tree. Specifically, it places files in type-specific subdirectories,
as follows:
'
.TS
l	l	l	.
\fBFile type\fR	\fBDirectory\fR	\fBFilename\fR
TFM	TEXMF/fonts/tfm/\fIvendor\fR/\fItypeface\fR/	\fIfontname\fR[--base].tfm
VF	TEXMF/fonts/vf/\fIvendor\fR/\fItypeface\fR/	\fIfontname\fR.vf
PL	TEXMF/fonts/pl/\fIvendor\fR/\fItypeface\fR/	\fIfontname\fR[--base].pl

psfonts.map	TEXMF/dvips/\fIvendor\fR/	\fIvendor\fR.map
.TE
.PP
"TEXMF" stands for the writable $TEXMF directory. \fIFontname\fR is the
font name supplied as otftotfm's second argument, and \fIPSfontname\fR is
the PostScript name of the input font. The \fIvendor\fR and \fItypeface\fR
strings are required by TDS; they default to "lcdftools" and the font's
family name, respectively, but see the
.B \-\-vendor
and
.B \-\-typeface
options below. \fISignature\fR is an opaque 6-character encoding signature.
.PP
You can override these directories with environment variables and options
as follows. Options take precedence over environment variables.

.PP
Otftotfm will update the
.I TEXMF/ls-R
file when installing files under TEXMF. After changing a psfonts.map file,
it also checks for an executable file called
.IR TEXMF/dvips/updmap ;
if found, this file is executed from the
.I TEXMF/dvips
directory.

.SS Font feature and transformation options
.PD 0
.TP 5
.BI \-s " script\fR[.\fIlang\fR], " \-\-script= "script\fR[.\fIlang\fR]"
Apply features suitable to the script system
.I script
and language system
.IR lang .
Scripts and language systems are two-to-four-letter names assigned by
Microsoft and Adobe. Examples include "latn" (Latin script), "grek" (Greek
script), and "yi.YIC" (Yi script with classic characters). If
.I lang
is not specified, otftotfm will use the default language system for that
script. You can give this option multiple times. Run "\fBotfinfo\fR
\-s \fIfont\fR" to see the list of scripts and languages a
font supports. Defaults to "latn".
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-f " feature\fR, " \-\-feature= "feature"
Activate the feature named
.IR feature .
Features are four-letter names assigned by Microsoft and Adobe; they are
meant to correspond to font behaviors, such as kerning or small-capitals.
Examples include "liga" (default ligatures), "dlig" (discretionary
ligatures), "kern" (kerning), and "c2sc" (replacing capitals with small
capitals). Give this option multiple times to apply multiple features. Run
"\fBotfinfo\fR \-f [--script option] \fIfont\fR" to see the list
of features a font supports for a specified script.
Defaults to any features required by the selected scripts.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-E " amt\fR, " \-\-extend= amt
Widen, or extend, the font by a factor of
.IR amt .
Like
.M afm2tfm 1 's
.B \-e
option.

.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-S " amt\fR, " \-\-slant= amt
Oblique, or slant, the font by

Like
.M afm2tfm 1 's
.B \-s
option.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-L " amt\fR, " \-\-letterspacing= amt
Letterspace each character by
.IR amt
units, where 1000 units equals one em. The width of each character
increases by
.IR amt ,
with half the space distributed to each sidebearing. Boundary-character
kerns are added to maintain alignment at the ends of lines.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-design\-size= size
Set the output font's design size to
.IR size ,
a value in TeX points. This value is mostly just documentation, since LaTeX
essentially ignores fonts' design sizes, but plain TeX may occasionally use
the design size to decide how large a font should be. (Loading a font in
TeX "at" a particular size effectively ignores the design size; loading a
font plain or "scaled" by a given factor uses the design size.) The default
is taken from the input font's optical size feature, or 10pt if it has no
such feature.

.BI \-e " encoding\fR, " \-\-encoding= encoding
Selects the
.M dvips 1
encoding used as a starting point. Otftotfm will search for
.IR encoding [.enc]
the same way that
.B dvips
would, so you may not need to give a full pathname. Defaults to the font's
encoding. See ENCODINGS, below, for more information on how otftotfm uses
encodings.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-literal\-encoding= encoding
Selects the
.M dvips 1
encoding used for the font. No glyph substitutions will be permitted, so
the output encoding will equal the input encoding (and otftotfm will not
generate an output encoding).
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-ligkern= command
Executes the specified LIGKERN
.IR command
in addition to any in the encoding. See ENCODINGS, below, for more
information on LIGKERN syntax. For example, "\fB\-\-ligkern\fR 'T {L} h'"
suppresses any T_h ligature in the font. You can supply multiple
.B \-\-ligkern
options.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-unicoding= command
Executes the specified UNICODING
.IR command
in addition to any in the encoding. See ENCODINGS, below, for more
information on UNICODINGs. For example, "\fB\-\-unicoding\fR 'pi1 =:
uni03D6'" tells otftotfm to encode "/pi1" as U+03D6 GREEK PI SYMBOL. You can
supply multiple
.B \-\-unicoding
options.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-coding\-scheme= scheme
Sets the font's TFM coding scheme to
.IR scheme ,
which must be a string less than 40 characters long containing no
parentheses. The default is the encoding's PostScript name. Most tools
ignore the coding scheme, so you probably don't need to worry about this
command unless you are using fontinst.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-boundary\-char= char
Sets the font's boundary character to
.IR char ,
which should be a number between -1 and 255. The default is taken from the

In automatic mode, TeX and friends will generally find required font files
independently of the vendor you select. However, you will need to

.SH ENCODINGS
.SS Commands
.PP
Otftotfm uses its input encodings by translating glyph names into Unicode
code points. For example, if an input encoding has "/dotlessi" at position
10, then otftotfm detects that the user wants to encode Unicode character
U+0131 LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I at position 10. The output encoding
will use whatever glyph the font suggests for that code point, given the
collection of features you chose.
.PP
You can control this process with "UNICODING" comments in the input
encoding file. UNICODING comments have the following format:
.nf
  % UNICODING \fIglyph\fR =: \fIchoice1\fR [\fIchoice2\fR ...] ;
.fi
\fIGlyph\fR and the
.IR choice s
are PostScript glyph names. This comment tells otftotfm that the glyph named
.I glyph 
translates into the first Unicode value in the
.I choice
list that has a character in the font. For example,
.nf
  % UNICODING pi1 =: uni03D6 ;
.fi
tells otftotfm that the character "/pi1" encodes as U+03D6 GREEK PI SYMBOL,
and
.nf
  % UNICODING Delta =: uni0394 uni2206 ;
.fi
tells it that U+0394 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA should be preferred to
U+2206 INCREMENT as an encoding for "/Delta". You can also supply regular
glyph names:
.nf
  % UNICODING Delta =: Deltagreek Delta ;
.fi
Otftotfm uses Adobe's
.I glyphlist.txt
file to translate regular glyph names to Unicode; see
.IR http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/type/unicodegn.html .
.LP
You can also map a glyph to nothing to remove that glyph from the input
encoding. This is useful to remove optional characters; for instance:
.nf
  % UNICODING ff =: ; fi =: ; fl =: ; ffi =: ; ffl =: ;
.fi
The f-ligatures will be added back to the encoding, preferably at their
original locations, if some font feature requires them.
.LP
Map a glyph to 'emptyslot' if you don't want otftotfm to use the slot for a
ligature character. For example, given this UNICODING,
.nf
 % UNICODING ff =: ff emptyslot ;
.fi
otftotfm will leave the 'ff' encoding slot unused if the font has no 'ff'
glyph. (Note that most OpenType fonts provide a visible representation for
unused encoding slots, namely a box with an X inside.)
.LP
Each UNICODING line can contain multiple commands, separated by spaced
semicolons.
.PP
Ligatures can be added and kerns inhibited by LIGKERN comments in the
encoding, as in
.M afm2tfm 1 .
To add a ligature, use this command form:
.nf
  % LIGKERN \fIglyph1\fR \fIglyph2\fR =: \fIresult\fR ;
.fi
The "=:" operator indicates a normal ligature, where both the input glyphs
are removed and replaced by
.IR result .
To preserve the left-hand glyph, for an effect like "\fIglyph1\fR
\fIglyph2\fR =: \fIglyph1\fR \fIresult\fR", use the "|=:" operator instead.
You can also say "=:|" to preserve the right-hand glyph. Otftotfm does not
yet support the other five ligature operators ("|=:|", "|=:>", "=:|>",
"|=:|>", and "|=:|>>").
.PP
To remove all kerns between two characters, say:
.nf
  % LIGKERN \fIglyph1\fR {} \fIglyph2\fR ;
.fi
Use a star "*" for one
.I glyph
to inhibit all matching kerns. For instance,
.nf
  % LIGKERN a {} * ;
.fi
removes all kerns with "a" as the left-hand character, and
.nf
  % LIGKERN * {} * ;
.fi
removes all kerns.
.PP
Otftotfm also supports extended syntax for inhibiting ligatures. This
command:
.nf
  % LIGKERN \fIglyph1\fR {L} \fIglyph2\fR ;
.fi
inhibits any ligature between
.I glyph1
and
.IR glyph2 .
"{K}", like "{}", inhibits kerns only, and "{LK}" and "{KL}" inhibit both
ligatures and kerns. Otftotfm parses "% LIGKERNX" comments as well as "%
LIGKERN" comments; it's probably better to put the extended commands in
LIGKERNX blocks, since that avoids confusing
.M afm2tfm 1 .
.PP
As with UNICODING, each LIGKERN or LIGKERNX line can contain multiple
commands, separated by spaced semicolons.
.PP
The
.B --unicoding
and
.B --ligkern
command line arguments let you add virtual UNICODING and LIGKERN comments
to an encoding.
.PP
Finally,  CODINGSCHEME command specifies a default
.B --coding-scheme
for the encoding; for example:
.nf
  % CODINGSCHEME EXTENDED TEX FONT ENCODING
.fi
'
.SS New glyphs
.PP
New glyphs, such as ligatures and contextual substitutions, are added to
the encoding in any empty spaces, using their original locations when
possible. If the encoding doesn't have enough space for all new glyphs,
shorter ligatures composed of unaccented letters get precedence.
'
.SS Synthetic glyphs
.PP
Otftotfm can synthesize some glyphs using virtual font manipulations, if a
required glyph is not available in the input font. Specifically, it will
synthesize "IJ", "ij", "Germandbls" (a capital "sharp-s", namely "SS"),
"cwm" (the TeX T1 encoding's compound word mark), and "visualspace" (the
TeX T1 encoding's visible space).
'
.SH "OPENTYPE FEATURES"
.LP
This section lists features common to Western OpenType fonts and describes
how otftotfm handles them for common fonts. Please send the author mail if
otftotfm does not handle a feature you need, or you believe it handles some
feature incorrectly.
.Sp
.PD 0
.TP 5
.IR aalt ", Access All Alternates"
Lets the user choose between all available alternate forms for a character.
This includes things like superscript and subscript variants, as well as
different styles (swash, for example). This is not likely useful for TeX,
since a TeX user can't interactively choose a given alternate form. Not
well supported. See also
.IR salt .
.TP 5
.IR c2sc ", Small Capitals From Capitals"
Replaces capital letters with small capitals: a sort of converse of the
more conventional
.I smcp
feature, which replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR calt ", Contextual Alternates"
Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms for each
character. For example, given the word "DREW" in a cursive typeface, the "R
E W" might be translated to calmer forms than the initial "D". There may be
more than one choice for a given letter, in which case the user should be
able to select among them. TeX can't support complex contextual alternates,
or alternate selection, but otftotfm supports some fonts quite well. The
input encoding should have lots of empty space for variants, and it should
specify a boundary character. See also
.IR cswh .
.TP 5
.IR case ", Case-Sensitive Forms"
Shifts punctuation marks up to a position that works well with
all-capital-letter sequences. For example, the hyphen character, which
generally centers vertically on the x-height, is raised up to center
vertically on a capital letter. Also replaces text figures with lining
figures, and accent marks with forms more appropriate for capitals.
Supported.
.TP 5
.IR cpsp ", Capital Spacing"
Adds a bit of space on either side of each capital letter. Supported.
(However, the OpenType tag registry suggests that
.I cpsp
be on by default, but applying to all-caps text only; TeX cannot easily
implement that contextual intelligence.)
.TP 5
.IR cswh ", Contextual Swash"
Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms for each
character. For example, in the words "Ab AC", the first "A" might be
translated to a swash form, while the second might not. There may be more
than one choice for a given letter, in which case the user should be able
to select among them. TeX can't support complex contextual swashes, or
alternate selection, but otftotfm supports some fonts quite well. The input
encoding should have lots of empty space for swash variants, and it should
specify a boundary character. See also
.IR calt .
.TP 5
.IR dlig ", Discretionary Ligatures"
Activates uncommon ligatures, such as "c_t", "s_p", and "s_t". Supported.
.TP 5
.IR dnom ", Denominators"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller forms sitting on
the baseline, intended for fraction denominators. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR fina ", Terminal Forms"
Substitutes appropriate forms for letters occurring at the ends of words.
This feature doesn't select swash variants; it's intended for normal use,
and the specification recommends that it be on by default. Partially
supported: TeX will only treat spaces as the ends of words, where a correct
implementation would probably include punctuation too. See
.IR cswh
for selecting swash variants active at the ends of words.
.TP 5
.IR frac ", Fractions"
Replaces simple sequences like "1/2" with nice-looking fractions.
Supported, but beware: many fonts will translate "11/32" into "1" + "1/3" +
"2".
.TP 5
.IR hist ", Historical Forms"
Replaces characters with historical variants. Usually, this means at least
translating regular "s" to long "s". Supported.
.TP 5
.IR kern ", Kerning"
Adjusts the space between characters (pair kerning). Generally supported,
and you should probably turn it on.
.TP 5
.IR liga ", Standard Ligatures"
Activates common ligatures, such as "f_f", "f_i", "f_f_j", and (in some
Adobe fonts) "T_h". Generally supported, and you should probably turn it
on.
.TP 5
.IR lnum ", Lining Figures"
Uses lining figures, the set of digits that are all about as high as
capital letters.
Supported. Compare
.IR onum ;
see also
.IR pnum
and
.IR tnum.
.TP 5
.IR numr ", Numerators"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller, raised forms
intended for fraction numerators. Supported, but not usually useful.
.TP 5
.IR onum ", Oldstyle Figures"
Uses old-style figures, also known as text figures. This is the set of
digits that have ascenders and descenders like lower-case letters.
Supported. Compare
.IR lnum ;
see also
.IR pnum
and
.IR tnum .
.TP 5
.IR ordn ", Ordinals"
Designed for Spanish and French. Replaces ordinal numbers, such as "2.o",
with forms where the "o" is raised, and replaces the sequence "No" with an
integrated glyph. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR ornm ", Ornaments"
Replaces some alphabetic characters in the font with ornaments, and links
the bullet character to a set of all bullet-like ornaments, from which the
user can choose. Partially supported: TeX can handle alphabetic
substitutions, but not bullet choice.
.TP 5
.IR pnum ", Proportional Figures"
Digits will have different widths. Supported. Compare
.IR tnum ;
see also
.IR lnum
and

.IR salt ", Stylistic Alternates"
Lets the user choose between stylistic alternate forms for a character.
Partially supported: A TeX user can't interactively choose a given
alternate form, so otftotfm takes the first option whenever there's more
than one choice. See also
.IR aalt
and
.IR ss01 ;
.IR salt
is generally more useful than
.IR aalt
for TeX, since it refers exclusively to stylistic alternates.
.TP 5
.IR sinf ", Scientific Inferiors"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller, lowered forms
intended for subscripts. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR size ", Optical Size"
This feature stores information about the range of optical sizes for which
the font was intended. There is no point in selecting it with otftotfm,
since it should not change the font's appearance in any way.
.TP 5
.IR smcp ", Small Capitals"
Replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported. Compare
.IR c2sc .
.TP 5
.IR ss01 - ss20 ", Stylistic Sets 1-20"
Replaces characters with a uniform set of stylistic alternates. Differs
from features like
.I salt
in that a Stylistic Set is uniform: an
.I ssXX
feature should never involve selection from a set of possible alternate
characters. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR sups ", Superscript"
Replaces digits, some punctuation marks, and some lower-case letters with
smaller, raised forms intended for superscripts. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR swsh ", Swash"
Activates all swash forms for each character. There may be more than one
swash form, in which case otftotfm will pick the first one listed.
Supported, except that swash variants other than the first are
inaccessible.
.TP 5
.IR tnum ", Tabular Figures"
All digits will have the same width, so that tables and the like will align
visually. Supported. Compare
.IR pnum ;
see also
.IR lnum
and
.IR onum.
.TP 5
.IR zero ", Slashed Zero"
Replaces the zero character with a slashed zero. Supported.

.TP 5
no writable directory found in $TEXMF
'
Otftotfm could not find a writable directory in your $TEXMF path. Did you
create a 
.I $HOME/texmf
directory? If so, run the command "kpsewhich --expand-path='$TEXMF'" to
verify that directory is not being found. You may need to set your TEXMF
environment variable, to '{!!'"$HOME"'/texmf,!!$TEXMFMAIN}', for instance
(note the different kinds of quotes; on my machine, this expands to
\&'{!!/home/kohler/texmf,!!$TEXMFMAIN}').

.TP 5
\&'\fIchar\fR' has no encoding, ignoring kern removal
.PD 0
.TP 5
(or ligature removal, lig/kern removal, or ligature)
.PD
'
These messages indicate a slight problem with your encoding file: one of
the LIGKERN commands referred to a character not present in the encoding.
This might be due to a misspelling in the LIGKERN command or the encoding
file, or it might be an oversight. Either fix the encoding file or ignore
the warning.
'
.TP 5
can't map '\fIchar\fR' to Unicode
'
Another encoding file problem: One of the glyph names in an UNICODING block
could not be converted to Unicode. This is problematic since UNICODING
exists wholly to translate glyph names into Unicode. Fix the encoding file
or ignore the warning.
'
.TP 5
ignoring unencodable glyph(s) ...
'
There wasn't space in the encoding for all the glyphs referred to by the
features you selected. For example, maybe the font had more ligatures than
there were empty slots in the encoding. Fix this warning by selecting fewer
features, or by using an encoding with more empty slots, such as the 7t.enc
encoding distributed with otftotfm.
'
.SH "BUGS"
.LP
Presumably some context-sensitive positionings and ligatures could be
implemented with TeX's boundary character, but otftotfm doesn't do that yet.
.LP
More positionings and ligatures could be supported with the help of virtual
fonts.
.LP
See the documentation for 
.B \-\-pl
above if you have problems running otftotfm's output through
.BR fontinst .
