LCDF Typetools NEWS

Version 2.0   21.Mar.2004

* mmpfb, t1dotlessj, t1lint, t1testpage: On Windows, add _O_BINARY flag
  when appropriate. Reported by Fabrice Popineau.


Version 1.99   24.Feb.2004

* otftotfm: Fix overfull encoding bug that could cause an assertion
  failure, reported by Adam Lindsay.

* otftotfm: Speed improvement.


Version 1.98   22.Feb.2004

* otftotfm: Add support for 'SSsmall' glyph. Einar Smith noted that the
  OpenType 'smcp' feature doesn't translate the sharp-S character to
  small-caps "SS" in most fonts. Now, add '--unicoding "germandbls =:
  SSsmall"' to get that behavior.

* otftotfm: Compilation fix for problem reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.


Version 1.97   6.Feb.2004

* cfftot1: Fix bug in handling fonts with supplemental encodings. Problem
  reported by Eike <eiked>.


Version 1.96   11.Jan.2004

* otftotfm: Handle alternate characters like 'Q.alt' in the input encoding:
  map them to the actual alternate glyph, rather than to the base Unicode
  value ('Q'). Reported by Ulrich Dirr.
 

Version 1.95   3.Jan.2004

* otftotfm: Add automatic support for t1dotlessj. If the desired encoding
  has a 'dotlessj' character, and the input font doesn't, then otftotfm
  will run 't1dotlessj', create a dotless-J font, and include it using
  virtual fonts.

* otftotfm: Avoid warnings about bad "(STOP)" commands in pltotf
  (introduced by the --min-kern facility).


Version 1.91   31.Dec.2003

* mmpfb, t1dotlessj: Fix sidebearing problems.


Version 1.90   29.Dec.2003

* mmpfb: Fix behavior with Adobe Jenson and other fonts with intermediate
  masters, and '--minimize' output, which had been broken since 1.65.

* Add t1dotlessj program.


Version 1.88   23.Dec.2003

* otfinfo: Change coding to be friendlier to older C++ compilers. Requested
  by Ulrich Dirr.


Version 1.87   22.Dec.2003

* otftotfm: Fix --extend bug reported by Ulrich Dirr (the expansion factor
  was formerly applied to character heights and depths, not widths).


Version 1.86   19.Dec.2003

* otftotfm: Change where "--base" is added to support pdftex: If the font
  name is "WarnoPro+10", the base font name is "WarnoPro--base+10".
  Reported by Ulrich Dirr.


Version 1.85   10.Dec.2003

* otftotfm: Add --altselector-feature option, so you can specify the
  features activated by --altselector-char.  Defaults to salt and dlig.

* otftotfm: Fix intermittent hang.


Version 1.80   4.Dec.2003

* otftotfm: Add --altselector-char option, and --include-alternates and
  --exclude-alternates options.  These options support access to alternate
  characters through ligatures, using a mechanism originally planned by
  Sivan Toledo ("Exploiting Rich Fonts", TUGboat 21(2), 2000).  Requested
  by Martin Budaj.

* Add default encoding for 'SS' character (same as 'Germandbls'). Reported
  by Ulrich Dirr.


Version 1.75   3.Dec.2003

* cfftot1: Handle the case when 'hintmask' is the first operator in a Type 2
  charstring. Reported by Tom Kacvinsky.


Version 1.70   1.Dec.2003

* otftotfm: Add --min-kern option requested by Ulrich Dirr.

* mmafm: Add --min-kern as a preferred synonym for --kern-precision. 


Version 1.67   29.Nov.2003

* otftotfm: Don't run off the end of an array. Bug reported and patch
  provided by Akira Kakuto.


Version 1.66   24.Nov.2003

* cfftot1: Don't generate "currentfile eexec" twice. Bug reported by Adam
  Lindsay.


Version 1.65   24.Nov.2003

* otftotfm: Include default ligatures if user does not specify ligatures.
  Requested by Adam Lindsay.

* otftotfm: Generated VPL includes FONTDSIZE when referring to base. Bug
  reported by Adam Lindsay.

* Preliminary support for CID-keyed OpenType fonts.


Version 1.60   7.Oct.2003

* cfftot1: Support fonts using the 'seac' operator. Requested by Ralf
  Koenig.


Version 1.52   4.Sep.2003

* otftotfm: Add --design-size option requested by Johannes Kuester.

* t1testpage: Fix --help and add manual page at C.M. Connelly's request.


Version 1.51   2.Sep.2003

* otftotfm: Generated TFM and PL files have DESIGNSIZE set to the font's
  actual design size, as read from the 'size' feature. Requested by
  Johannes Kuester.


Version 1.50   26.Aug.2003

* Minor compilation fix; problem reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.


Version 1.50b4   26.Aug.2003

* otfinfo: Minor compilation fix from Tom Kacvinsky.


Version 1.50b3   25.Aug.2003 

* cfftot1: Emit UniqueID as an integer. Reported by Tom Kacvinsky.

* otftotfm: '--without-kpathsea' fix. Patch provided by Adam Lindsay.

* More compilation fixes provided by Tom Kacvinsky.


Version 1.50b2   24.Aug.2003

* otfinfo: New program, requested by Adam Lindsay.

* otftotfm: The '--query-scripts' and '--query-features' options are no
  longer supported. Use 'otfinfo -s' and 'otfinfo -f' instead.

* otftotfm: Fix crash reported by Adam Lindsay.

* otftotfm: In automatic mode, after modifying a 'psfonts.map' file, run
  the script 'TEXMF/dvips/updmap' if present.

* Compilation fixes for Solaris provided by Tom Kacvinsky and Nelson
  H.F. Beebe.


Version 1.50b1   20.Aug.2003

* Integrate mminstance (the mmafm and mmpfb programs), and bump the version
  number to reflect this.


Version 0.53   10.Aug.2003

* Fix problem with Type 1 output in '--without-kpathsea' reported by Adam
  Lindsay.

* Fix crash on encodings containing 'emptyslot' reported by Marco Kuhlmann.


Version 0.52   7.Aug.2003

* Attempt to fix some build problems reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.


Version 0.51   5.Aug.2003

* otftotfm: Fix crashes with small encodings and absent boundary
  characters. Reported by Bruce D'Arcus.

* otftotfm: Add '--boundary-char' and '--kpathsea-debug' options.


Version 0.50   4.Aug.2003

* otftotfm: Handle more complex substitutions, such as those required to
  support '-fordn' and '-ffrac'.

* otftotfm: The output virtual and base fonts can have different
  "encodings" with overlapping encoding slots. This can make fonts more
  compact.

* When assigning slots to introduced characters, otftotfm prefers
  characters introduced by earlier lookups. This follows the spirit of the
  OpenType specification, since early lookups in some ways "override" later
  ones. The previous scoring mechanism remains in force within each
  individual lookup.

* otftotfm: Rewrite GsubEncoding to Metrics, changing its fundamental
  abstraction (to two-ligatures). Simpler and cleaner overall.

* otftotfm TODO: Ligatures that apply to middle or right context (for
  example, the two substitutions "a b c d => a b c y" and "b c => x" should
  combine to "a b c d => a x y", but they won't yet).


Version 0.19   30.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Add support for 'emptyslot' UNICODINGs. Requested by Marco
  Kuhlmann.


Version 0.18   9.Jul.2003

* Otftotfm will now synthesize characters for some T1 glyphs automatically,
  specifically 'cwm' (compound word mark), 'visualspace', and 'Germandbls'.
  Requested by Marco Kuhlmann.

* The glyphlist.txt file contains Unicode mappings for character names
  found in the BlueSky Computer Modern math italic and symbol fonts.

* It also contains fake Unicode mappings for the 'cwm', 'visualspace', and
  'Germandbls' characters found in EC.enc.

* otftotfm: Don't output a KRN between two characters if there exists a LIG
  for those two characters.


Version 0.17   6.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Ligatures removed with LIGKERN commands won't show up in the
  encoding.

* Improve scoring heuristics by which otftotfm decides which characters are
  more important (for when there isn't enough encoding space for all new
  glyphs).


Version 0.16   6.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: In automatic mode, store dvips files (encodings and
  psfonts.map) in 'TEXMF/dvips/VENDOR', rather than 'TEXMF/dvips'. Users of
  previous versions will probably want to move their 'TEXMF/dvips/a_*.enc'
  and 'TEXMF/dvips/lcdftools.map' files to a 'TEXMF/dvips/lcdftools/'
  directory, and run 'mktexlsr TEXMF'.

* otftotfm: When there isn't enough encoding space for all new glyphs,
  prefer shorter ligatures made out of regular letters -- for instance,
  prefer f_j to f_f_j, and T_h to f_iacute. Requested by Bruce D'Arcus.

* otftotfm: Add '--ligkern' and '--unicoding' options.

* otftotfm: Add '--coding-scheme' option and '% CODINGSCHEME' encoding
  comment, to define the PL/TFM coding scheme for the font. Apparently
  fontinst actually looks at the coding scheme. Also, when you specify a
  coding scheme, set DESIGNUNITS to 1, again to satisfy fontinst. Requested
  by Marco Kuhlmann.

* otftotfm: Remove virtual font 'N.vf' when installing a regular font
  'N.tfm' in automatic mode. This reduces the risk that an old virtual font
  will screw up your installation.


Version 0.15   4.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Bug fix: Don't multiply apply substitutions and kerns from the
  same lookup.

* otftotfm: Supports simple left-contextual substitutions, necessary for
  ExPontoPro's 'calt' (Contextual Alternates) feature.


Version 0.14   2.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Add '-L/--letterspacing' option at Bruce D'Arcus's request.

* otftotfm: Hypothetically supports the contextual substitutions necessary
  for the 'init' (Initial Forms) feature.

* otftotfm: When you make a virtual font named "foo", remove any entries
  for "foo" from VENDOR.map.


Version 0.13   27.Jun.2003

* --without-kpathsea works. Problem reported by Adam Lindsay.


Version 0.12   27.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Better error messages when directories cannot be found.
  Reported by Bruce D'Arcus.


Version 0.11   26.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Handles the contextual substitutions necessary for 'cswh'
  (Contextual Swash) and 'fina' (Terminal Forms) features.


Version 0.10   26.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Update ls-R files for new encodings.


Version 0.9   25.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: psfonts.map lines contain the file name only (no directories).
  Requested by Norbert Preining.

* otftotfm: Properly report errors when encoding files can't be found.

* Fix kpathsea searching and dependency problems reported by Bruce D'Arcus
  and Claire Connelly, among others.

* Fix templates to allow compilation with GCC 2.95.


Version 0.8   23.Jun.2003

* otftopl has been renamed to otftotfm. The new program takes different
  options. Automatic mode is particularly different, and TFM output is now
  the default.

* otftotfm: Automatic mode now sticks files into a TeX Directory Structure
  hierarchy. This works well with many TeX installations. It also
  automatically translates OpenType fonts into Type 1 PostScript with
  cfftot1 (unless you configure with --disable-cfftot1), and modifies a
  psfonts.map file for each font. See the manual page for more information.

* otftotfm: Generates virtual fonts when required to support glyph
  positioning features. ("-f cpsp" is one example.)

* otftotfm: Warns when a feature could not be completely implemented.

* otftotfm: Add --verbose and --no-create options, among others
  (--no-virtual, --map-file, --vendor, --typeface, --no-type1...).

* otftotfm: Encoding files are now named "a_SIGNATURE.enc", not
  "auto_SIGNATURE.enc".

* The configure script now searches for the kpathsea library, since
  otftotfm's automatic mode depends on kpathsea. Provide
  '--without-kpathsea' to disable it.


Version 0.7   13.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix bug to handle MinionPro-Italic without crashing.


Version 0.6   12.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix definitions of Subrs entries 1 and 2; now fonts with flex
  hints will work.

* cfftot1: Reduce noise generated by fonts with flex hints.

* cfftot1: Generates valid character strings for characters whose first
  point is at the origin. (Previously, such charstrings wouldn't begin with
  a "moveto".)

* otftopl: Support simple context substitutions and chained context
  substitutions. Required to support ACaslonPro-Italic's "swsh" feature.
  Reported by Adam Lindsay <atl@comp.lancs.ac.uk>.

* otftopl: Prefer '--query-features' and '--query-scripts' to
  '--print-features' and '--print-scripts'.

* otftopl: Better warnings and error messages for bad LIGKERN/UNICODING
  commands in encoding files, and when there isn't enough room in an
  encoding for ligature glyphs.

* t1lint: Reads stdin if no filenames supplied on the command line.


Version 0.5   5.Jun.2003

* Template reorganization so the typetools compile with GCC 3.3.


Version 0.4   3.Jun.2003

* otftopl: Added --slant and --extend options.

* otftopl's generated encodings have slightly different form, and are thus
  friendlier to ps2pk's bad parser.


Version 0.3   3.Jun.2003

* Fixed bug: cfftot1 produced invalid results for fonts with encodings
  other than StandardEncoding, due to a misbehavior in the way Type 1 fonts
  were stored. Reported by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.2   3.Jun.2003

* Fix CFF parsing bugs and configure errors reported by Vladimir Volovich
  <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.1   2.Jun.2003

* Initial release.
